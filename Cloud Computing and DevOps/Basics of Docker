Docker
Docker allows you to pack you application and it's dependencies (code, libraries, configurations) into a container that can be then used to run on any laptop, server or cloud.
Imagine you are a chef and you need a portable kitchen that you can take anywhere, to a festival, farmer's market etc. Docker is like that portable kitchen that will allow you 
to pack everything you need to cook in a container and setup whereever needed.

Docker Container
Docker Container is a lightweight, standalone, executable package that has all the information needed to the run you application.
In terms of our example, Docker container is the portable kitchen, that has the stove(environment), Recipie(application code) and Utensils(dependent libraries)

Docker File
Docker File, contains the steps that are needed to create the Docker Image.
It is basically the instruction of how to build the image

Docker Image
Docker Image is a static file, that provides information that the container needs, i.e.
- The application code
- The enviornment needed to run the application code
- How to start the application
For the above example, imagine docker image is a set of instruction that are needed in order to setup the portable kitchen and start cooking.
